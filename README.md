# World Population Data Analysis and Visualization
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

## AIM
Analyze and visualize the population distribution of different countries over the years using bar charts and histograms. The dataset used contains population data for various countries over multiple years.

## METHODOLOGY
1. Importing Dataset
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Analysis and Visualization
4. Repeative analysis of chosen country

## Libraries used
- `pandas` : Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy` : Numerical computations
-  `seaborn` : Data visualization library 
-  `matplotlib.pyplot` : Plotting library for static and interactive visualizations

## Conclusion
This project offers insights into the population distribution of various countries over the years. By visualizing population trends and distributions, it facilitates understanding demographic patterns and changes over time.
